1. Even or Odd
  O(1) because we are only performing one operation

2. Are you here?
  O(n^2) because there is a nested for loop

3. Doubler
  O(n) because we are looping through the array once  

4. Naive Search
  O(n) because we are looping through the entire array

5. Creating Pairs
  O(n^2) because we have a nested for loop
  
6. Creating Fibonacci
  O(n) because the number of operations depend on the argument number

7. Efficient Search
  O(log(n)) because we are splitting our array length in half each iteration  

8. Random Element
  O(1) because it searches the array once, with a random index, then returns element

9. Is it prime?
  O(n) since we are testing each number less than our input number  

10. Counting Sheep (R)
  O(n) Dependent on the value of the argument.

11. Array Double (R)
  O(n) Dependent on the length of the array.

12. Reverse String (R)
  O(n) Dependent on the length of the string.

13. Triangular Number (R)
  O(n) Dependent on the value of parameter.

14. String Splitter (R)
  O(n) Dependent on string size for recursive looping.
